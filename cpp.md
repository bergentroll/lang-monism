# CPP

## Description

_Short description, supported paradigms, major links._

One of early OOP languages, C++ invented by __ Bjarne Stroustrup in 80s as a superset of the C language. Low level at a one hand, powerful at a second, still evolutioning at another one.

There are C++03, C++11, C++14, C++17 and C++20 present-day standards, where number means year of acceptance.

C++ provides procedural, objective and build time generic paradigms of coding.

* [C++ reference](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp) — free online documentation with offline options :book:
* [Standard C++](https://isocpp.org/) — official site devoted to ISO standard of the lang :globe\_with\_meridians:

## Toolset

* G++ — compiler from the "[GNU Compiler Collection](https://gcc.gnu.org/)"
* [CLang](https://clang.llvm.org/) — popular LLVM based compiler
* [Boost](https://www.boost.org/) — giant libraries collection which is a "semi-standard library"
* [CMake](https://cmake.org/) — modern build system
* [Valgrind](https://valgrind.org/) — anslizys tool with memory leaks detection

## Basic syntax

_Sample of code flow._

## Comments

_Code documentation syntax and agreements._

## Project model

_Modules, import or including. Major project files, common structure of library and application. Local environment._

## Type system

_\* Dynamic or static_ _\* Strong or weak_ _\* Explicit or implicit_

_Scopes, variables lifecycle, copying and referencing, modificators like constant._

_Generics._

## Base types and data structures

_Built-in types, most common collections._

## Strings

_Standard types to store strings. Tools and practices to splice, search, copy, replace textual data._

## Execution flow statements

_Loops, conditions and jump operator or recursion._

## Subroutines

_Functions, procedures, lambda expressions etc._

## Object model

_Object-oriented programming tools, syntax of classes._

## Exceptions

_Handling exceptions or errors. Major exceptions hierarchy._

## Filesystem

_Most common tools to deal with files and directories._

## Introspection

_Reflection and metaprogramming tools._

## Asyncronous model

_Asyncronous calls, multithreading, multiprocessing._
